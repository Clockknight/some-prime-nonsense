# some-prime-nonsense

The intent of this program is to generate some composite number "N" for the combo in [this decklist](https://moxfield.com/decks/60C4okZqKEaREDOJ3En6AA). 

This number 
 - avoids the rules of divisibility [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility_rule#Divisibility_rules_for_numbers_1%E2%88%9230)
 - and is intended to be humanly incalculable (currently generated numbers will be larger than 2^50)
to make guessing the factor as difficult as possible.
